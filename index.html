    <h3>Nick Petrilla: The Wiseman Special</h3>
    <p>
      <span>My name</span> is Nick Petrilla. I surf and skate and work at an art school doing Ed Tech stuff. I use a Mac.

      Getting my local + hosting environment set up wasn't too hard. I've used Github a little and I already have hosting through Bluehost so I went ahead and setup shell access through it. I had to speak to support at Bluehost first because SSH is not a default setting. I am used to using FTP so I'm glad I learned a new way. The way I did it was a little different from the video but I figured it out.
